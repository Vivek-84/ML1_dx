    "   - The goal is to find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance.\n",
    "   - Techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation are commonly used.\n",

    "   - The model is trained on a dataset that contains a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data.\n",
    "   - The idea is that the labeled data can guide the learning process while the unlabeled data helps capture underlying \n",

    "In machine learning, the train-test-validation split is a common practice for evaluating and improving the performance of a\n",

    "main subsets are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training Set:\n",
    "   - The training set is the portion of the dataset that the model learns from. It is used to train the model's parameters and\n",

    "   - A larger training set can help the model learn more accurately, but it should be representative of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validation Set:\n",
    "   - The validation set is a subset of the data that is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions about the model's \n",

    "   - It is not used directly for training the model's parameters but helps in evaluating the model's performance during \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Clustering-based Anomaly Detection:\n",

    "     anomalies might form their own clusters or exist as outliers.\n",
    "   - Anomalies can be identified as data points that don't fit well into any of the existing clusters or are in sparse clusters.\n",
    "   - Common techniques: K-means clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), Isolation \n",
    "    Forest.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Anomalies are typically located in low-density regions of the data.\n",

    "4. Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "   - Autoencoders are neural network architectures that learn to encode data into a lower-dimensional representation and then\n",

    "   - Autoencoders can capture complex data patterns, making them effective for anomaly detection.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Statistical Approaches:\n",
    "   - Statistical methods assume that normal data follows a particular statistical distribution, and anomalies deviate \n",
    "     significantly from this distribution.\n",
    "   - Techniques like Z-score, Mahalanobis distance, and percentile-based methods can be used to identify anomalies based on \n",
    "     statistical measures.\n",
